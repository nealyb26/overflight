# overflight

Thanks for checking out *overflight*, an interactive local air-traffic visualization app built with three.js! This project started as a Google Assistant Action from a few years ago. It would tell users about the nearest plane flying overhead, a fun feature that Apple Siri used to do with Wolfram Alpha.  

Once Google Assistant Actions were sunsetted, I considered making a web application using the Flask backend but never settled on an implementation. I found three.js as a way forward, eventually leading to *overflight*. Hosted the container in winter 2024 with Google Cloud Run; so make sure to visit the site!
