# overflight

Interactive air traffic visualization application built on three.js.
The simple Flask backend is reused from a Google Assistant Action I made a few years ago.
It would user the nearest plane flying overhead, a cool feature that Apple's Siri used to be able to do. 
Once Google Assistant Actions were sunsetted, I always considered making an application using the backend
but never settled on an implementation. I saw three.js as a way forward, eventually leading to Overflight.
I finally hosted the container this winter using Google Cloud Run; seeing this project done is nice.

Thanks for checking it out - I hope you enjoy it!
